# Pong Game
<br>
According Wikipedia:
<i> Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. 
The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey; Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement. Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.

This little game intends to remember old things can be fun again.
That is why it was recreated in Javascript  showcasing ES5 and ES6 functions where "less" is "more".

It also happens the game is part of my learning effort so don't expect perfection. (BTW I'm open to suggestions to improve it as long as it remains simple and fun)
